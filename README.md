# E.M.M. (Egg Monitor Master) System MVP Overview

##Introduction:
Welcome to the E.M.M. System MVP README, where we introduce an innovative solution designed to revolutionize egg incubation management. In the realm of poultry farming and enthusiasts, ensuring optimal conditions for egg incubation is paramount for successful hatching and healthy chicks. The E.M.M. System MVP addresses the challenges faced by poultry farmers and enthusiasts by providing a comprehensive platform for monitoring and managing egg incubators with precision and ease.

## Architecture Overview:

### Client-Side (Frontend):
-  Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Utilizes React components for dynamic and interactive elements.
- User authentication module ensures secure logins and sign-ups.
### Server-Side (Backend):
-  Powered by Flask framework.
-  API routes for communication.
-  Database access layer using SQLAlchemy.
-  Backend console implemented in Python for server-side operations.
###  Database:
-  SQL database (SQLite) stores user data and incubator readings.
-  Tables include 'users' and 'incubator_readings'.
-  API (Application Programming Interface):
-  Provides endpoints for user-related operations and dashboard data retrieval.
-  Handles communication between the frontend and backend components.
## Data Visualization:
-  Utilizes Dash framework for interactive data visualization.
-  Plotly library used to generate graphs and tables dynamically.
## User Authentication:
-  JWT (JSON Web Tokens) generated during login for subsequent API requests.
-  Ensures secure access to user-specific data and functionalities.
## Backend Console:
-  Python script executes background tasks and server-side operations.
-  Facilitates data simulation for testing purposes.

#  Technical Implementation:

##  Hashing Passwords:
-  Utilizes SHA256 algorithm for password hashing with unique salt for enhanced security.
##  Database Management:
-  SQLite database employed for data storage.
-  SQLAlchemy ORM facilitates database interactions.
##  User Registration and Authentication:
-  Flask routes handle user registration and login functionalities.
-  Secure storage and verification of user credentials.
##  Data Visualization:
-  Dash framework integrated for interactive data visualization.
-  Plotly library used to generate graphs and tables dynamically.
##  Background Data Generation:
-  DataGeneratorThread simulates incubator readings in the background.
-  Periodic data generation and storage in the database.
##  Session Management:
-  Flask session management ensures seamless user experience across requests.
-  Secure storage of session keys for user authentication.
##  Error Handling:
-  Comprehensive error handling mechanisms implemented.
-  Logging of events and errors for debugging purposes.
#  Additional Technical Details:

##  Data Generation Module:
-  Generates random temperature and humidity readings.
-  Associates data with a random user from the database.
-  Facilitates continuous data generation for testing and simulation.
